Professional WordPress Themes
Welcome to the Persistence Theme for WordPress!

Persistence marks a new phase in my theme development for WordPress users and for the future with WordPress 3. Over time, theme design will get even more advanced as I continue to add more and more themes to my WordPress themes portfolio.

The Persistence theme for WordPress is an example of what is yet to come plus more. Over the span of this year, each new theme will have more features built in as I fine-tune a standard framework for my WordPress themes and templates.
Persistence Features

    Multiple Page layout options: full width, 2 columns (left column + main content), 2 columns (main content + right column), 3 columns (main content + inset + right column), 2 columns equal width (main content + Right column).
    9 Widget positions to give you flexible modular layouts.
    The default menu option uses a built-in suckerfish menu
    Built-in Breadcrumb navigation
    Have different header images or media using Widget Logic.
    4 Page templates

PHOTOSHOP Template Customization

If you decide you want to make custom modifications to this template, you will need the actual files used to create this theme for Joomla. Only select memberships gives access to these so if you are not on any Photoshop membership, you can always upgrade to gain access. Keep note that the Photoshop templates are not released under the GPL license and may not be redistributed or resold in any way or form without written permission from Pixel Theme Studio.
WordPress Themes

Persistence will be tested for WordPress 3.0 because as you may be aware that WordPress 3 is coming and many are wondering if themes and templates from Pixel Theme Studio will work on this new version. My themes will be available for the WordPress 3 version and will be classified as WordPress 3 templates on the PTS website with an icon. If any previous templates need upgrading, a review will be done as to which ones will be on the list - or possibly re-designed! You can keep up to date with the PTS blog as well any Information FAQ's for Themes and Templates.
